Welcome to Prompt Engineering Essentials.

I'm Amanda, the Chief Learning Officer at writingIO. This mini course will teach you the most important skill in working with A I: writing effective prompts.

This video and all videos in this course were created with an A I tool, which allows us to keep content current in this fast moving field.

Here's the truth about A I. The quality of what you get out depends entirely on what you put in. Vague prompts get vague results. Specific, well-crafted prompts get useful responses.

Think of prompting like giving directions. If you tell someone to go somewhere without details, they might end up anywhere. But clear directions with landmarks and specifics get them exactly where you need.

A I works the same way. It needs context, clarity, and specificity to give you what you actually want.

In this mini course, you'll learn the building blocks of effective prompts, how to add context and specificity, techniques for iterating and improving results, and ready to use templates for common tasks.

By the end, you'll write prompts that get dramatically better results. Let's get started.
