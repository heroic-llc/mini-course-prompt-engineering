What makes a prompt effective? Let's break down the key components.

A good prompt typically has four parts: role, context, task, and format.

Role tells A I who to be. You are a marketing expert. You are a patient teacher. You are a critical editor. Role shapes the perspective and tone of responses.

Context provides background. I'm writing for small business owners. This is for a technical audience. I need this for a job application. Context helps A I tailor its response appropriately.

Task is what you want done. Write a summary. Explain this concept. Generate five ideas. Identify problems in this text. Be specific about the action.

Format describes how you want the output. Give me bullet points. Write in three paragraphs. Create a table. Keep it under one hundred words. Format prevents getting responses that don't fit your needs.

Here's an example combining all four.

You are an experienced career coach. I'm a software developer with five years experience looking to move into management. Write a cover letter for a team lead position. Keep it professional but personable, about three hundred words.

Role: career coach. Context: developer seeking management. Task: write cover letter. Format: three hundred words, professional but personable.

Not every prompt needs all four elements. But knowing these building blocks helps you craft more effective prompts consistently.
