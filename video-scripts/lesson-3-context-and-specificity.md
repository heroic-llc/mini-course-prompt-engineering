The more context you give, the better A I can help you.

Vague prompt: Write about productivity. This could go anywhere.

Better prompt: Write a five hundred word blog post about productivity tips for remote workers who struggle with work life balance. Tone should be encouraging, not preachy. Include at least one tip about setting boundaries.

The second prompt gives A I everything it needs: topic, audience, length, tone, and specific requirements.

Here are ways to add useful context.

Specify your audience. Who will read or use this? Experts or beginners? Executives or front line staff? General public or specialists?

Explain your purpose. Is this for learning, persuading, informing, or entertaining? Will it be a presentation, email, report, or social post?

Share constraints. Word limits, time constraints, required elements, things to avoid. Constraints help A I focus.

Provide examples. If you have examples of what you want or don't want, share them. A I learns quickly from examples.

Give background. What has already happened? What does A I need to know that isn't obvious?

A common mistake is assuming A I knows what you know. It doesn't. When in doubt, include more context rather than less.

You can always ask A I to be more concise. But if it doesn't have enough information to start, the response will miss the mark.
